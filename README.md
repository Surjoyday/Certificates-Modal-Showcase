# Certificates Modal Showcase

This project showcases a modal window developed using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM). The modal window displays my collection of e-learning certificates earned up until October 2023.

## Overview

The modal window is a visual representation of my e-learning journey, presenting certificates earned throughout the year. It is created using JavaScript and DOM manipulation techniques.

## Key Learnings

During the development of this modal window, I focused on learning and implementing several key concepts:

### 1. Working with ClassList Property in DOM

Utilized the `.classList` property and its methods to manipulate classes within the DOM elements, enabling smooth transitions and visual effects for the modal window.

### 2. Practical Use of QuerySelectorAll in DOM

Explored scenarios where `.querySelectorAll` proves beneficial, leveraging it to efficiently select multiple elements within the DOM.

### 3. Handling Keypress Events with AddEventListener

Implemented `.addEventListener` to capture keypress events, specifically exploring the three types of keyboard events: `keydown`, `keypress`, and `keyup`.

### 4. Understanding Global Event and Event Object

Learned about the concept of a global event and how JavaScript captures information about the pressed key within the event object. Leveraged this information by passing a variable as a parameter in the event handler function.

### 5. Event Object Utilization for Specific Keypress Actions

Utilized the event object automatically passed to the event handler function by the JS engine, enabling targeted actions based on specific keypress events.

## Usage

The modal window showcases the e-learning certificates earned, accessed by triggering specific keyboard events. Navigate through the certificates using the specified keys for a seamless browsing experience.
